// Perimeter of squares in a rectangle, 5 kyu
The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
It's easy to see that the sum of the perimeters of these squares is : 4 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 * 20 = 80

Could you give the sum of the perimeters of all the squares in a rectangle when there are 
n + 1 squares disposed in the same manner as in the drawing:

#Hint: See Fibonacci sequence

#Ref: http://oeis.org/A000045

The function perimeter has for parameter n where n + 1 is the number of squares (they are numbered from 0 to n) and returns the total perimeter of all the squares.




// Solution:

function perimeter(n) {
    let sum = 0
    
    let prevNum = 0
    let currentNum = 1
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++){
      sum += currentNum
      currentNum = prevNum + currentNum
      prevNum = currentNum - prevNum
    }
    
    return 4*sum
}
