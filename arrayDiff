//Array.diff, 6 kyu

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, 
which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b:
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]



//Solution:

function array_diff(a, b) {
  let finalArr = []
  
  for (let i = 0; i<a.length; i++){
    let element = a[i]
    if (!b.includes(element)){
      finalArr.push(element)
    }
  }
  return finalArr
}
